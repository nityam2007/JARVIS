### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project, and add the following line:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=<yourkey>
```

This key is necessary to connect Jarvis with the Groq API.

Example `.env` file:

```env
# .env.example
GROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Rename this file to `.env` after setting your API key.

### 6. Run Jarvis
